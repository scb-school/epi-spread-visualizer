# Overview
With this library, I am creating a tool that will assist in visualizing the spread of a disease according to an inputted line listing of populations becoming sick over time, translating this data into a map that will change based on a slider simulating the passage of time. My library will use data visualization tools already in place, such as Plotly DASH, as well as some data-processing tools like Python Pandas, combining these two to make the final result.
